    WhatsApp was founded in February 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo!. In January 2009, after Koum purchased an iPhone, he and Acton decided to create an app for the App Store. The idea started off as an app that would display statuses in a phones Contacts menu, showing if a person was at work or on a call.[62]Their discussions often took place at the home of Koums Russian friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose. They realized that to take the idea further, they would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.[62] Koum named the app WhatsApp to sound like "what\'s up". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated[63] WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a "few more months".[62] In June 2009, when the app had been downloaded by only a handful of Fishmans Russian-speaking friends, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app. Koum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user\'s network would be notified when a user\'s status changed.</string>
